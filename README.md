### Node-GroupChat

#### Functionality

- GroupChat is a mock chat application that allows users to communicate with each other via Web Sockets. Users can join any chat room they like, and begin communicating with other users in that chat room in real time.
- Note that this app was provided by Springboard and was mainly an exercise for me to read and understand code for an existing application. Now that I have an idea of how the application works, I will be adding more functionality at a later date.

#### Technicalities

- To get this code onto your machine, run `git clone https://github.com/jlh040/Node-Express-GroupChat.git`
- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), and run `npm install` to download all of the dependencies.
- Next, run `node server.js` to start the server up on port 3000.
- Go to **localhost:3000/room-name** (*where room-name is any name*) to enter a chat room.
